## [Adapter](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/adapter-design-pattern.html)
- Current Code with the old vendors's API (XPay in the example)

- Now, the current code interface is not compatible with the new vendor’s API. (PayD in the example)

## [Composite](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/composite-design-pattern.html)
- Typical Composite object structure.

- The Component defines an interface or abstract class for all objects in the composition both the composite and the leaf nodes. The Component may implement a default behavior for generic methods.

- The Composite’s role is to define the behavior of the components having children and to store child components. The Composite also implements the Leaf related operations.

## [Bridge](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/bridge-design-pattern.html)

- The components of the Bridge Pattern comprise of an abstraction, refined abstraction, an implementer, and concrete implementer.

## [Singleton](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/singleton-design-pattern.html)

## [Observer](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/observer-design-pattern.html)
- The key objects in this pattern are subject and observer.
- A subject may have any number of dependent observers.
- All observers are notified whenever the subject undergoes a change in its state. In response, each observer will query the subject to synchronize its state with the subject state.
