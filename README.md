## [Adapter](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/adapter-design-pattern.html)
- Current Code with the old vendors's API (XPay in the example)

- Now, the current code interface is not compatible with the new vendor’s API. (PayD in the example)

## [Composite](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/composite-design-pattern.html)
- Typical Composite object structure.

- The Component defines an interface or abstract class for all objects in the composition both the composite and the leaf nodes. The Component may implement a default behavior for generic methods.

- The Composite’s role is to define the behavior of the components having children and to store child components. The Composite also implements the Leaf related operations.

## [Bridge](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/bridge-design-pattern.html)
<img src="https://www.javacodegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/class_diagram_2.jpg" alt="Bridge 1">

- The components of the Bridge Pattern comprise of an abstraction, refined abstraction, an implementer, and concrete implementer.

## [Singleton](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/singleton-design-pattern.html)

## [Observer](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/observer-design-pattern.html)
- The key objects in this pattern are subject and observer.
- A subject may have any number of dependent observers.
- All observers are notified whenever the subject undergoes a change in its state. In response, each observer will query the subject to synchronize its state with the subject state.

## [Mediator](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/mediator-design-pattern.html)
- Before Mediator the interaction between the classes might look like this, containing references of each other.

- After implementing a Mediator the interaction between the classes looks like this, only containing a reference to the mediator.

- Using a Mediator means the interaction code has to reside in only one place, and that makes it easier to maintain.
- More formal structure of the Mediator Pattern.

The major participants of the Mediator Pattern are:
1. Mediator: Defines an interface for communicating with Colleague objects.
2. ConcreteMediator: Implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects. It also knows and maintains its colleagues.
3. Colleague Classes: Each Colleague class knows its Mediator object. Each colleague communicates with its mediator whenever it would have otherwise communicated with another colleague.

## [Proxy](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/09/proxy-design-pattern.html)
- The client does not know about the proxy, the proxy acts as an original object for the client.

1. Proxy:
- 1a. Maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the real subject. Proxy may refer to a Subject if the RealSubject and Subject interfaces are the same.
- 1b. Provides an interface identical to Subject’s so that a proxy can be substituted for the real subject.
- 1c. Controls access to the real subject and may be responsible for creating and deleting it.
2. Subject:
- 2a. Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy so that a Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
3. RealSubject:
- 3a. Defines the real object that the proxy represents.

There are three main variations to the Proxy Pattern:
1. A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object in a different address space.
2. A virtual proxy creates expensive objects on demand.
3. A protection proxy controls access to the original object. Protection proxies are useful when objects should have different access rights.
